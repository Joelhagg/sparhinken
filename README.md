<h1> What is it? </h1>
<p>

    Sparhinken is an app where the user is able to get an better understanding and overview of its privet economy.

    The main idea of this app is to get people more intrested in privet economy and the importence of having a buffer savings.

    The app is ment to be seeen as a visual tool for learning and a fun "think outside the box" perspective for people that is not interested in private economy.

    The basics of this plan is to picture buckets that are being filled with water, when the first bucket is filled it spilles over to the next one and so on.
    The sizes of buckets are controled by the fixed montly expences.

    Like in most games, we are controlling resources in a visual way, i like to make saving i bit more fun with this mindset!

<h1>What is the bucket strategy?</h1>

<p>

    In the simplest way, it it a strategy that is made up by bucket, each bucket up to 4 varies in size and should be filled with different assets.

    Bucket 1.
    The first bucket acts like a buffer savings, with low risk of loosing mony like investment in a regular bank account with interest.
    And a size that is recomended to be about 3 months expenditures.
    If greater risk of needing more money, like if you own a house, it probably should be a bit bigger.
    The main goal is to be able to sleep good at night, knowing that you have money if needed.

    Bucket 2.
    This one should be a bit bigger, the aim is 5 times larger the the first one.
    For investment, a portfolio of 60% Stocks and 40% bonds is a great choice, a good mix between risk and return.
    The aim with this bucket is to expand the buffer but with some greater risk.
    As the stocks investment sort should be, i do believe in Index stocks.

    Bucket 3.
    This is the High risk bucket! When the first two are filled you should start filling this one, it can grow as big as you want!
    The investment assets should be 100% Stocks, recommendation is also Index Stocks.
    This one is a great pension saving bucket. Long savings horizon!

    Bucket 4.
    Optional! With this bucket you are able to live out any investment interest that you may have. As ain aim, it should not exceed 10% in size of the bucket 3.
    And should be filled with alternative investments like, gold certificates, crypto, wine or maby art collections.

    In this way, i think that you can eliminate the worry about money, just stick to this simple plan and beleve in the system!
    This is a guide and not i life style. Dont forget to live life and spend money when you can, as in everything, balance is key.

    "Money is not money until it is spent."
