## What is it?

Sparhinken is an app where the user is able to get an better understanding and overview of its privet economy.

The main idea of this app is to get people more intrested in private economy and the importence of having a buffer savings.

The app is ment to be seeen as a visual tool for learning and a fun "think outside the box" perspective for people that is not interested in private economy.

The basics of this plan is to picture buckets that are being filled with water, when the first bucket is filled it spilles over to the next one and so on.
The sizes of buckets are controled by the fixed montly expences.
